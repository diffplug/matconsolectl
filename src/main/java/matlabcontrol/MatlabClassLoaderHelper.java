/**
 * Configures class loading inside of MATLAB such that it will work properly with RMI.
 * <br><br>
 * MATLAB uses {@code com.mathworks.jmi.CustomURLClassLoader} to load classes. Class loaders first ask their parent
 * class loader to attempt to load the class and so on up the chain all the way to the system class loader. (This is by
 * convention, one which {@code CustomURLClassLoader} follows). All classes listed on MATLAB's static class path
 * (defined in the {@code matlabroot/toolbox/local/classpath.txt} file where {@code matlabroot} is the location of
 * MATLAB) will be known to the system class loader. As such, all Java classes listed on the static class path will
 * be loaded by the system class loader. Classes listed on MATLAB's dynamic class path via the {@code javaaddpath}
 * function will be loaded by {@code CustomURLClassLoader}.
 * <br><br>
 * When matlabcontrol is started outside MATLAB and launches a session of MATLAB it adds itself to MATLAB's dynamic
 * classpath. This allows matlabcontrol's code to run inside of MATLAB without needing to find and then modify the
 * classpath.txt file (which also very well might not be desired by the user). When matlabcontrol is started inside
 * MATLAB the user may have placed it on either the static or dynamic class path (the user could do both, but the
 * static class path would be used and the dynamic would be ignored). matlabcontrol cannot initially control which
 * class loader knows about matlabcontrol.
 * <br><br>
 * The reason all of this matters is because of how RMI loads classes. When RMI attempts to load a class it starts by
 * asking the current thread for its class loader (@code Thread#getContextClassLoader}. (If that does not work it can
 * then attempt to load the class from a remote location, but this feature is not used by matlabcontrol and so this
 * step does not occur.) The class loader that is returned by the thread RMI is running on will not be MATLAB's
 * {@code CustomURLClassLoader}. As such, RMI will not operate properly if matlabcontrol was added to the dynamic class
 * path.
 * <br><br>
 * When a class loader is attempting to load a class, it starts with its parent class loader and so on up the chain. By
 * informing the system class loader of the location of matlabcontrol, then RMI's class loader will be able to find the
 * matlabcontrol classes. This can be done via reflection (see {@link #addToSystemClassLoader()}. Once the
 * system class  loader knows about the classes in matlabcontrol it will load the classes. If classes have been loaded
 * by the {@code CustomURLClassLoader} then problems can arise. The classes loaded by the system class loader and those
 * loaded by {@code CustomURLClassLoader} will exist in separate <strong>runtime</strong> packages, meaning they can
 * only access public classes, methods, and fields of one another.
 * <br><br>
 * {@code MatlabClassLoaderHelper} manipulates class loading. If the system class loader knows about matlabcontrol
 * then no action is taken. Otherwise, the system class loader is told about matlabcontrol. When matlabcontrol launches
 * a session of MATLAB this class is called before any other class is loaded, and this class is never used again. As
 * such, if this class is loaded by the {@code CustomURLClassLoader}, it will not be a problem.
