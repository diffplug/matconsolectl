 * This class must be public so that it can be created via reflection by {@link RemoteClassLoader}. If it were package
 * private it would result in an {@link IllegalAccessError} because only classes in the same package as a package
 * private class may construct it (even via reflection). It has been placed in the {@code matlabcontrol.internal}
 * package to make it clear it is not intended for use by users of matlabcontrol.
 * <br><br>
 * A custom service provider for the RMI class loader. Allows for loading classes sent from the external JVM and
 * providing annotations so that the external JVM may load classes defined only in the MATLAB JVM. Loading classes from
 * the external JVM could be accomplished by setting {@code java.rmi.server.codebase} property in the external JVM but
 * that could interfere with other uses of RMI in the application. There is no way to always sending the correct
 * annotations without this custom rmi class loader spi. While the {@code java.rmi.server.codebase} property could be
 * set in the MATLAB JVM, the property is checked only at load time. This would mean that class definitions added
 * dynamically with {@code javaaddpath} could not be sent.
